1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 344 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?

>>> The number that friend_overlap function gives is the number of two objects¡¯ common friends. The similarity cannot be measured by number of common friends only since the denominators are different, which means two pairs of objects¡¯ base number are different. Therefore, to compare number of common friends only will brings misleading for accuracy. 
One possible way to fix this issue, percentage measurement of overlaps on total number might be a good idea. 




2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.


>>> The result gives ¡°WhiteHouse¡±. Since Trump and Hillary are rivals for election, whitehouse are mostly reasonable is followed by both of them. 





3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?


>>> The result gives us different candidates¡¯ different personality and social strategy that they try to manage through social media. Trump follows less people that cause less commons friends with others. On the contrary, Johnson gets more. The number of common friends will influence something in social media analysis, but we definitely need more method and tools to analyze data for reaching more information from data.






4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?

>>> Except overlap, there are total 5670 friends from all candidates. According to twitter can handle 15 request in 15min window, 5670/15 = 378 requests total by 15-min windows. The complete request takes 5670 mins.
